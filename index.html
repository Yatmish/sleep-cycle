            <p id='description-output'>It takes the average human about 15 minutes to fall asleep.
            To wake up refreshed at 8:30 AM, you should go to bed at one of the following</p>
            
            <div class="time-container">

            <p>
                If you wake up at one of these times, you'll rise in between 90-minute sleep cycles. A good night's sleep consists of
                5-6 complete sleep cycles.

        <h1>Sleep Calculator FAQ</h1>
        <p>Here are the answers to our most frequently asked questions about calculating sleep times.</p>
        <h3>What time should I wake up and go to bed?</h3>
        <p class='answer'>Everyone has a different circadian rhythm. Some people are better off going to bed early and waking up early (early
        birds), while others do better going to sleep later and waking up later.</p>
        <h3>Does your need for sleep change with age?</h3>
        <p class='answer'>Yes. As we age, the number of hours of sleep needed daily decreases. For example, newborns need 14-17 hours/day, while
        adults aged 65 and over need 7-8 hours/day.</p>
        <h3>What time should I go to bed if I wake up at 6?</h3>
        <p class="answer">If you wake up at 6 am, to get 7-9 hours of sleep you should be going to bed between 9 pm and 11 pm.</p>
        <h3>Why am I still tired after sleeping for 8 hours?</h3>
        <p class="answer">You may need 8.5 hours or 9 hours of sleep/night. If that doesn't help, you should focus on improving the quality of
        your sleep by understanding basic sleep hygiene guidelines.</p>
        <h3>Is it healthy to sleep in the morning?</h3>
        <p class="answer">Our circadian rhythm determines our sleep/wake cycles. These are determined principally by heat and light, making it
        natural to sleep when it's colder and darker, and wake when it's light and warmer.</p>
        <h3>How do I stop waking up tired?</h3>
        <p class="answer">Understanding basic sleep hygiene can give you insight into what things you may be doing that are causing you to have
        trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, and waking up tired.</p>
